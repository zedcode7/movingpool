        <h2>What are moving pool floors?</h2>

        <p>
          As the name suggests, these are floors of swimming pools that move to
          alter the depth of the pool or even make it a solid floor with the
          pool hidden beneath it. The most common types are false floors that
          move up and down through the pool water, but there are also systems
          that roll on and off the top of the pool on rails. This facilitates
          the pool room or the pool space (in case of outdoor pools) to be used
          for more than one purpose. For example, a 10m X 4m pool fitted with a
          moving floor in a 15m X 6m room will allow you to have a 90 sqm room
          (easily the biggest room in the house) for parties or events.
